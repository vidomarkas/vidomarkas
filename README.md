Hi, I'm Viktoras

I'm passionate about looking for new ways to create and trying out latest web technologies.

My skills include front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React). I use tools such as Git, Figma, Adobe XD.

Currently, I am looking to become a member of a professional developer team to level up my skills and collaborate with like minded people.
